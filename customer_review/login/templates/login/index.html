<p>Sentiment analysis can be a key indicator of customer satisfaction and customer experience. Customer experience is the key to business success. In fact, after a positive experience, more than 85% of customers purchase more. Twenty-five percent, however, drop a product or brand after just one bad experience. That proves that poor customer experiences can be costly.<br>
	<br>
Rather than assuming, you know how your customers experience your business? , is there a way to really understand what makes for great customer experiences? If there were a way to analyze customer feedback, could it be used to retain more of your customers? (I hope you know where weâ€™re going with this.)
<br>
<br>
The answer lies in analyzing review sentiment! </p>
