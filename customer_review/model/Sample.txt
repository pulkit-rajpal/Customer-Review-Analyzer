I'm really surprised at the negative reviews on these wipers.
I bought two pairs of wipers just over a year ago, expecting 
I'd have the second pair as backup. I haven't needed the second pair 
- the first pair are still just like new - they don't squeak, 
chatter, or smear and are great for visibility.
